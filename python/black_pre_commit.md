# Using black and pre-commit

I find that trying to keep [pep-8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) in my head while working on python adds friction.

So I want to outsource as much of the stylistic/formating rules to some automation.

[LJ Miranda](https://ljvmiranda921.github.io/notebook/2018/06/21/precommits-using-black-and-flake8/) has an excellent guide for setting up git pre-commits to work with [black](https://github.com/psf/black) that scratches this itch.
