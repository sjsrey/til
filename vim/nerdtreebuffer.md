# Using Bookmarks in NERDTREE

In my migration back to vim from emacs, I'm getting reaquainted with [Nerdtree]

One of the things I made heavy use of under emacs was bookmarks. Glad to see
NERDTree has them.

Once in NERDTree, a `B` will toggle boomkars on.

Really nice way to get to a file that is buried at some depth in the file
system.
