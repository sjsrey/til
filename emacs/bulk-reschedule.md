# Rescheduling mulitple items in org-agenda

Many times I have items that I have scheduled but have not attended to. These
show up in the agenda and I need to reschedule them. To do so in agenda mode:
```
m   # mark each item to reschedule
Bs
```
From there select the date in the schedule interface to shift the scheduled date
for all marked items.


## Bonus
If I would rather like to unschedule these events:

```
m
C-u
Bs
```
